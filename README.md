# FIGURE Is Generalizing Universal Runtime Environments

This is Figure.  Welcome!

Nothing much exists right now.  But I have to start somewhere.

Try 'make check' to run the test suite.  As is expected with test-driven development, I frequently commit code that just barely passes the tests.  More tests will be added to break the suite, and then code to fix it again.

Have fun!
